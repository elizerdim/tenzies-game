### What I learned

I completed this project on Scrimba back in September 2023 when I was first learning React and wanted to include it here for reference. I coded some parts differently while creating a repo from it, which was a great opportunity to practice React and JavaScript in general. used Math.random(), Set, conditional rendering, useState, and npm packages nanoid and react-confetti, which was particularly fun!
